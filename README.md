# microsoft-clipart-catalog

Parses the clipart catalogs from various editions of Microsoft Office.

## Motivation
I noticed the CAG files included with Office 97 included lots of very interesting strings that didn't seem to 
have much to do with clip art. So I wrote this script purely out of curiosity - I wanted to understand what 
content actually related to the clipart (keywords, descriptions, and so forth) and what strings were unrelated.
